//! Per-function build state for IR lowering.
//!
//! `FunctionBuildState` holds all state that is created fresh for each function
//! being lowered and discarded afterward. This makes the function-vs-module
//! lifecycle boundary explicit: the Lowerer wraps this in `Option<FunctionBuildState>`,
//! which is `None` between functions.
//!
//! Scope management uses an undo-log pattern (`FuncScopeFrame`) rather than
//! cloning entire HashMaps at scope boundaries. On scope exit, only the changes
//! made within that scope are undone, giving O(changes) cost instead of O(total).
