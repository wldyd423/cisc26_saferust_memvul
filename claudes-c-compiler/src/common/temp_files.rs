//! Proper temp file handling with RAII cleanup and $TMPDIR support.
//!
//! Provides:
//! - `temp_dir()`: returns the platform temp directory (respects $TMPDIR)
//! - `TempFile`: RAII guard that deletes the file on drop (even on panic/error)
//! - `make_temp_path()`: generates a unique temp file path
